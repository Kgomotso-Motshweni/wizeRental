# Apartment Finder

An app that is responsible for helping Low income people to find accommodation and landlords to advertise their properties. A landlord gets to post their available property for rental e.g â€œBackroom". All tenants will see the available property and apply for the accommodation. The landlord will see the application for rental and decide to either accept or decline their application. Once the tenant is accepted then they  will proceed to sign the memorandum of agreement in the app.
